M2 or **ManeFrame II** is a *supercomputing cluster*: a set of powerful computers that are connected to each other. It is built and maintained by Southern Methodist University.

M2 was built in 2017 to replace the retired cluster ManeFrame I (M1) and has been having several updates.

M2 was last benchmarked at 870 Tflops in 2019.

The M2 is maintained by 2 teams: a team of *system administrators*, who work directly at the cluster, and monitors its hardware and operating system, and a team of *HPC Applications*, who work with the SMU M2 users. The two teams work very closely together. As HPC Application services, we provide training workshops, online help and support.

We maintain a [very extensive website](https://s2.smu.edu/hpc/documentation/) which hosts plenty of information for M2 users. We have ~600 people using M2 everyday; they come from a variety of departments: Computer Science, Mathematic, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, etc. M2 accounts are free for all SMU faculty, staff, and students.
